For example, the Clojure layer is composed of 9 different packages that you would otherwise have to know about and install and then get them to work together with a bit of configuration code.  Layers make things very simple, requiring only one word to be added to the Spacemacs configuration file.\n\n HintSPC SPC butterfly to activate in Spacemacs.  Use this great power very carefully.\nSimple Configuration\nSpacemacs provides a well tested configuration file called ~/.spacemacs that provides lots of sensible defaults and makes customising your experience very easy.  This file is created during the Spacemacs installation.\nThe ~/.spacemacs configuration file is composed of three important sections\n\n\n\nSection\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\ndotspacemacs/layers\nLayers provide a simple way to add language support and tooling to Spacemacs.  A layer can contain elisp configuration and packages from Melpa/Elpa.  Individual Emacs packages can also be added (if they do not exist in any layer)\n\n\ndotspacemacs/init\nconfiguration applied when Spacemacs first starts, eg evil or holy mode(emacs), themes, fonts, full screen, recent files, etc\n\n\ndotspacemacs/user-config\nAdd your own customisation here\n\n\n\n Example .spacemacs configurationReview the authors current .spacemacs configuration file for examples of changes and the dotfile configuration section of the Spacemacs documentation for a complete overview.\nOpening and reloading the configuration file\nSpacemacs provides specific keybindings for opening and reloading the ~/.spacemacs configuration file.\n\n\n\nVim Normal\nEmacs\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nSPC f e d\nM-m f e d\nopen the ~/.spacemacs file\n\n\nSPC f e R\nM-m f e R\nreload the configuration from ~/.spacemacs\n\n\n\n Restart after changing configurationThe bigger a change you are making in the ~/.spacemacs configuration file, the more desirable it is to restart Emacs.  For example, if you are adding a large layer or multiple layers and pulling in a number of packages.\nUnless its a small change, then restart Emacs with SPC q r\nAdding a Layer\nSimply open the ~/.spacemacs file and add the name of the layer you want in the section dotspacemacs-configuration-layers.  Some layers also take additional configuration in the form of variables in the layer definition.\nSee the Spacemacs documentation for a list of layers or open the help in Spacemacs SPC h SPC to list all the layers, pressing RET on a layer name to read about it.\n\n  Notes for existing Emacs usersIf you have configured Emacs before, you can consider the .spacemacs file as a replacement for the init.el file you would otherwise use to define your Emacs configuration.Installing packages via the packages-list-packages method is ignored by Spacemacs.  Any packages installed in this way will be ignored.If no layer exists for a package, you can use a package without a layer.You can add what ever elisp you like to the dotspacemacs/user-config section of the ~/.spacemacs configuration file.\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"why-spacemacs/clojure-layer.html":{"url":"why-spacemacs/clojure-layer.html","title":"Clojure Layer","body":"Clojure Layer Overview\nThe Clojure layer provides and full language support and tooling including, autocomplete, refactor, inspector and debugger, etc.\nThis layer supports Clojure projects managed by Leiningen, Boot and Clojure CALI tools (deps.edn).\n\n CIDER is part of the Clojure layerThe Clojure layer is a collection of Emacs packages and curated configuration to ensure those packages work well together in Spacemacs.

Each state has a specific purpose, eg. normal mode is about manipulating existing text where insert state is about adding more text.\nUsing a state for different types of editing actions greatly simplifies the keyboard bindings and arguably makes editing faster, especially once you get used to multi-state editing.\nThis speed is in part due to simpler keybinding when in normal mode as you are not typing content into the editor, simply running commands with each key press.  This means you can have single characters to do many of the common commands, eg l instead of C-f for moving the cursor forward.\nIf you are deeply connected to the with Emacs keybindings, then probably best to stick to holy mode.\nIf you are new to Emacs or you just want to take advantage of Vim, then select Evil mode.\n Evil flagship - toggling between EmacsYou can toggle between any of the Vim states and the Emacs state with C-z.

You can also move symbols and expressions around without risking unmatched parenthesis or other structure characters (using slurp, barf, wrap, unwrap, etc.).\n Structured Editing SectionRead the Structured editing section for a detailed guide to using Lisp mode, Smartparens, Paredit and Evil mode to manage your Clojure (and elsip) code.\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"why-spacemacs/project-file-navigation.html":{"url":"why-spacemacs/project-file-navigation.html","title":"Project & File navigation","body":"Project and File Navigation\nProjectile provides easy project management and navigation.

The Vim Quick Reference will help you use Spacemacs more effectively.\n Spacemacs for Vim usersMigrating from Vim article helps Vimmers get up to speed with Spacemacs.\nThe two most important things to learn about Spacemacs first are the Space menu and the Help system.\nSpace bar - main menu\nAll of the features of Spacemacs are available through the Space bar menu.\nPress SPC and you get a mnemonic menu to easily navigate through the multitude of functions you can call.\nIf a function does not have a menu item, you can still find it using SPC SPC and start typing its name.  Thanks to the helm completion framework, you will see a list of functions that are a fuzzy match for what you typed.\n\nSpacemacs Help system\nSpacemacs has a built in help system to help you find out what functions and keybindings do.\nComprehensive documentation is available on the Spacemacs website and built in to Spacemacs itself, so you can always access it when you are offline.\nEvery function has a description of how to use it as well as a link to its source code (in case you need more than the description).\nMany functions have a keybinding (keyboard short-cut) and you can also get a description of the keybinding.\n\n\n\nKeybinding\nAction\n\n\n\n\nSPC h SPC\nhelm popup lists Spacemacs documentation and layer guides\n\n\nSPC h d f\nhelm popup lists functions and shows the description of the specified function\n\n\nSPC h d k\nhelm popup lists keybindings and shows the description of the specified keybinding\n\n\n\nSubstitute M-m for SPC in the keybindings if you are only using Emacs holy mode.\n Keybinding guideSPC means press the spacebarA character by itself means press that key by itself, eg. h means press the h keyM-m means to hold the meta key down and press the m keyM-x means hold the meta key down and press the x keyThe meta key is typically Alt on Linux/PC, Opt on MacOSX\n\n  Spacemacs Documentation OnlineThe Spacemacs online documentation contains the same information as the built in help system.The Spacemacs Quick Start guide gives an overview of how to configure Spacemacs.\nSpacemacs in action\nIf you like to see Spacemacs in action, then you should watch the series of Spacemacs ABC videos on Youtube.  These videos walk you thought the common features of Spacemacs in alphabetical order.\nThere are also short screencasts of Spacemacs that accompany this book (work in progress).\nEmacs Wiki\nMost of the classic documentation about Emacs is also relevant to Spacemacs, after all its Emacs underneath.

Windows are used to split up the Emacs frame into sections.  This allows you to display multiple buffers (files, REPL, error messages, etc) at the same time.\nEach window has a number enabling you to jump between windows, e.g. SPC 1 takes you to window number 1.\nSome of the common windows functions include:\n\n\n\nkeybinding\naction\n\n\n\n\nSPC w\nOpens Window menu\n\n\nSPC w .\nOpen Window transient state menu for multiple command\n\n\nSPC w 2\n2 window layout - shows current buffer in new window\n\n\nSPC w 3\n3 window layout - shows current buffer in new windows\n\n\nSPC w m\nmaximise the current buffer\n\n\nSPC w d\ndelete current window\n\n\n\nGolden Ratio\nGolden-ratio automatically lays out windows in a Fibonacci style pattern.

So using g c 3 j will comment out the current line and the following two lines below.  You can comment out in reverse using g c 3 k.\nIn Visual state, v, select the lines you wish to comment and use g c to comment all the marked lines.

If you type a word that Spacemacs does not recognise then that word is underscored in red.  To correct a spelling:\n\nMove to the word that is incorrectly spelt\nSPC S c to change the word and show a list of suggested words\nEither type in a new spelling or use C-j and C-k keys to move down and back up the list of words, using RET to select that word.\n\nScrolling\nin vim command mode you can scroll just the text using the classic vi bindings.  This does not scroll the cursor unless the cursor hist the top or bottom of the window, in which case the cursor stays at that window boundry.\nC-y - scroll down\nC-e - scroll text up\nInserting a character multiple times\nIn Vim normal mode (yellow) type the number of times to repeat the character followed immediately followed by i, then the character or word you want to reapeat.  Then press ESC or fd and the character will be printed repeatedly\nredrum redrum redrum redrum redrum redrum redrum redrum redrum redrum\njump around...\nSPC j i shows imenu that lists all the def and defn expressions in the current buffer, allowing you to jump to one of these definitions directly by typing its name or using C-j and C-k to select the name and pressing RET to jump to the name in the buffer\nSPC j l labels each line of the buffer with a short, unique character code.  By entering the character code you are taken directly to the specific line.

The clear language design is supported by a powerful development environment known as the REPL (read, evaluate, print, loop).  The REPL gives you instant feedback on what your code does and enables you to test either a single expression or run the whole application (including tests).\nThe approach I take is called REPL driven development and I&apos;ll explain that here in detail.\nAlways running a REPL\nAs soon as I open a Clojure file I will start the REPL.  Coding without a REPL feels like tying my hands behind my back.  I want to get fast feedback from my code as I design it, testing my assumptions and design choices.\n\nEvaluating source code\nUse Clojure source code buffers to evaluate code and display the results inline.\n  Evaluate and Comment, e ; will evaluate the current form and print the result under the expression as a commentAdding results as comments is a great way to demonstrate the design of your code, especially in a journal.\nDesign Journal\nIt is highly recommended to journal your design process to make your code easier to understand and maintain.  Journals avoid the need for long hand-over or developer on-boarding processes as the journey through design decisions are already documented.\nIt is recommended to create a Design Journal section at the bottom of each namespace.  This journal should cover\n\nAll the important REPL experiments used to create the resulting namespace code.\nDiscussions of design choices, including those not taken and why.\nExpressions that can be evaluated to explain how a function or parts of a function works\n\nThe design journal can be used to create meaningful documentation for the project very easily and should prevent time spent on repeating exactly the same conversations.\n Add example journalDesign Journal for TicTacToe game using reagent, clojurescript and scalable vector graphics\nViewing data structures\nUse Pretty Print to view data structures that are the result of evaluating your code.  This makes those data structures easier to parse as a developer and more likely to notice incorrect results.\nCider Inspector is also a great way to navigate through a nested data structure.\n View large data sets, e P with open a new buffer with the results of the current function and so it very useful for larger data results.\nCode Style and idiomatic Clojure\n work in progress, sorry\nJoker for continuous Linting\nEastwood for Linting coverage\nKibit for idiomatic Clojure suggestions\nTest Driven Development and REPL Driven Development\nYou can use TDD and RDD together, there is a very natural merging of these approaches as they both encourage incremental changes and continuous feedback.  Test Driven Development also works well with Hammock Time, as you should spend more time thinking about what you want to do than typing code.  Tests provide an easy way to define and test your assumptions of your well considered design\nWith the power of the REPL, it is easy to get feedback on exactly how your code works.  Tests provide the codification of your evolving design and give you feedback when you break that design.\nAt some point before production you should have unit tests around the public API of each namespace in your project to catch regressions before committed.  It is much more efficient in terms of thinking time to create these tests as you stabilise the design that as an after thought.  So it makes sense to write these tests as part of the design process.\n Automate local test runnerSet up an automated test runner that will run on each file save\nContinuous Integration\n work in progress, sorry\nWire up a continuous integration server that runs tests and builds code on every shared commit (or every commit if you run a CI server locally).\nSpin up testable deployments of your application or service based on pre-defined branch commits or every commit if you do not share branches (i.e. push to shared master or develop branch), eg.

In this lisp-state you can use single character commands to move symbols and expressions around without risking unmatched parenthesis or other structure characters.\nThe lisp-state uses smartparens commands, so its a great way to learn structural editing.\n\nAlternatives: paredit and parinfer\nParedit was the original structural editing mode just for lisps, however, it is not actively maintained.  The Clojure layer in Spacemacs actually includes paredit, however no keybindings are defined, so you either have to use commands via SPC SPC or add your own keybindings to dotspacemacs/user-config, preferably using hooks on the Clojure mode.\nParinfer is relatively new and self describes as a bit of an experiment.  It does provide a bit more indentation automation which for some is great and for others quite confusing or annoying.\nEnable Vim support for Structural editing\nSafe Structural editing in Vim normal state respects structural editing too, meaning the standard vim commands can be used for cutting and deleting text without breaking Clojure or Lisp code structures.\nSafe structural editing is provided by the package evil-cleverparens which is included in the Clojure layer. By default this mode is not activated.\n\n\n\nSpacemacs\nVim\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nSPC m T s\n, T s\nEnable evil safe structural editing for the current buffer\n\n\n\nWhen enabled the symbol =&#x1F182;= is displayed in the mode-line.\n\nEnable for all =clojure= buffers by adding the following function in =dotspacemacs/user-config=\n(spacemacs/toggle-evil-safe-lisp-structural-editing-on-register-hook-clojure-mode)\n To enable evil safe structural editing for all supported modes:\n(spacemacs/toggle-evil-safe-lisp-structural-editing-on-register-hooks)\nBy adding clever-smartparens or evil-smartparens then Vim Normal state editing\n Move Vim alternatives to own sectionAlthough it is not structural editing, in Vim mode you can delete to a particular character.

Smart parens is a newer implementation of the classic paredit package.\n\nHint Take a look at the smart parens readme file for instructions on how to use Smartparens (I will incorporate that information in this workshop at a later date).\n\nBalanced parens &amp; other characters\nsmartparens keeps your parenthesis in balance by automatically creating a closing paren when you type an open paren.\nThis also happens for other character delimiters, such as [] for vectors, {} for maps and &quot;&quot; for strings.\nWith strict mode on, then you are unable to delete any of these delimiters until they are empty.  For example I could not delete any paren of the following expression until I delete the content of the expression (def brackets &quot;They are the best&quot;)\nI would have to delete the contents of this def expression before I could remove the open or close paren.\n\n  \n\n\nCommands Highlights\nSmartparens package provides additional functions for navigating and manipulating strictly balanced expressions.

Simply typing in a snippet name and pressing TAB or using SPC SPC yas-expand gives you the full text &amp; code structure from the snippet template.\nFor example, if you are defining a new function in Clojure then type defn and press TAB to expand to the full definition structure, including all parens.  Then use TAB to move through the structure to complete the name, doc-string, arguments and behaviour of the function.\nLets look at the built-in snippets that come with the Clojure layer in Spacemacs (and should be the default in Emacs YASnippet package).\n Write your own snippetsIts easy to wrtie your own snippets for Clojure or any other language you use with Spacemacs / Emacs\nWhere do Snippets fit in\nThere are several ways to speed up typing your Clojure code, Leiningen Templates, autocompletion, clj-refactor and YASnippets.\nSnippets are a great way to create much of the common code structures you typically write as you are developing your code.  The snippets I use the most are defn, let, ifl and for.\nSome of the snippets are made redundant by other Clojure layer features in Spacemacs.  For example, when I create a new file then the namespace is automatically added, so I rarely use the ns snippet.  I also use clj-refactor which takes care of adding require statements for me, so the require snippet is rarely used.\nDefault snippets for Clojure\nThe snippets that are available in Spacemacs can be found in the yasnippet github repository or in the ~/.emacs.d/elpa/yasnippet-20160501.1841/snippets/clojure-mode directory on your laptop (when yasnippet package is updated then name of that directory will change).\nAll the current snippets for Clojure mode are in the following table, indicating which tab stops they have.\n\n\n\nSnippet\nDescription\nTab Stops\n\n\n\n\nbench\nbenchmark an expression, using the time function\nbody\n\n\nbp\ndepreciated: break point in swank\n\n\n\ndef\ndef expression\nN/A\n\n\ndefm\ndefmacro expression, with name, doc-string, arguments &amp; body tabstops\nname, docstring, args, body\n\n\ndefn\ndefn expression, with name, doc-string, arguments &amp; body tabstops\nname, docstring, args, body\n\n\ndefr\ndefrecord\ndocstring, object, args, body\n\n\ndeft\ndeftype\ndocstring, object, args, body\n\n\ndoseq\ndoseq\nname, body\n\n\nfn\nfn - anonymous function\nname, body\n\n\nfor\nfor\ncondition, body\n\n\nif\nif\ncondition, body\n\n\nifl\nif-let - if true, bind a local name\nbinding, body\n\n\nimport\nimport java library\nlibrary name\n\n\nis\nis - clojure test assertion\nvalue, expected\n\n\nlet\nlet - bind a local name to a value\nname, value, body\n\n\nmap\nmap\nfn, col, col\n\n\nmap.lambda\nmap with anonymous function #()\nfn, body\n\n\nmdoc\nmetadata docstring\ndocstring\n\n\nns\nns - expression with the current namespace inserted automatically\nN/A\n\n\nopts\ndestructuring a map with :keys, :or for default values, :as for entire vector\n:key binding, or defaults, :as binding\n\n\npr\nprn - print function\nstring/value\n\n\nprint\nprintln - print function\nstring/value\n\n\nreduce\nreduce - reduce expression with an anonymous function\nargs, body\n\n\nrequire\n:require expression with library and alias\nlibrary, alias\n\n\ntest\ndeftest expression\ntest description, value/expected\n\n\ntry\ntry &amp; catch expression\ntry expression, exception name, body\n\n\nuse\ndepreciated: use require instead\n\n\n\nwhen\nwhen\nwhen expression, body\n\n\nwhenl\nwhen-let - local binding on when condition\nbinding, body\n\n\n\n  Writing org-mode tables in markdownThe above table was created in Emacs markdown mode by enabling the minor mode: orgtbl-mode.

However, YASnippets also uses a simple template system in plain text, so its pretty easy to learn.  Lets look at how to add your own snippets with Spacemacs.\nautomatically create snippets\nSelect a code block that you often create and using the yasnippets tools to create your own generic template\n\nPress v for visual mode and move the cursor around to select the text, or SPC v to grow the selected region\nSPC SPC helm-yas-create-snippet-on-region creates a new snippet\nEnter the name you wish to refer to this snippet\nSelect the major mode you want to add the snippet too (eg. clojure, markdown, html)\nEdit the text and delete any text that is not required\nAdd tab points in the snippet if relevant\n$1 initial cursor position, $2 next cursor position on tab, $0 end cursor position.\n\n\nSPC SPC yas-tryout-snippet to test the snippet has the right behaviour\nSPC SPC yas-load-snippet-buffer to load the snippet into the defined mode\n\nManually adding snippets\nThe easiest place to add your own snippet definitions is in the ~/.emacs.d/private/snippets directory.  Under this directory structure you should create a folder named after the relevant mode for your snippets, eg markdown-mode.  Inside this mode folder, create files whos names are based on the snippet alias you wish.\nSo for a work in progress snipped called wip in markdown mode I created ~/.emacs.d/private/snippets/markdown-mode/wip file.\nYou need to load this new snippet into Spacemacs by either restarting or using the command M-x yas-load-snippet-buffer command in the buffer of the new snippet you have just written.  Ths snippet with then work within any markdown mode buffer.\nManaging your snippets\nAlthough the private snippets directory is easy to use, it is not under version control.  So although its not over-riddend by Spacemacs it also means your private snippets are not backed up anywhere.\nIf you use the ~/.spacemacs.d/snippets/modename-mode/ directory structure for your snippets then you can version them with Git or similar versioning tools.\nHow to write a snippet\nEach snippet template is contained in its own file, named after the alias of the snippet.  So a snippet called wip will be in a filename wip, in a directory named after the relevant Emacs mode.\nThe basic structure of a snippet template is:\n#name : FullNameOfSnippet (not the alias name, the full name shows in autocompletion menu)\n#contributor: John Stevenson &lt;john@jr0cket.co.uk&gt;\n# --\nAdd the content you want to replace the snippet name with when it expands\nThe content can be anything, simple text or more usefully a code strucuture with placeholders\nExample: Simple text replacement\nI use markdown mode for writing a lot of content, especially for technical workshops.  As I am developing these workshops its useful to highlight which sections are still work in progress.  Rather than type the common message I use, I&#39;ve created a simple snippet called wip.\n#name : WorkInProgress\n#contributor: John Stevenson &lt;john@jr0cket.co.uk&gt;\n# --\n&gt; **Fixme** work in progress\nWhen you expand this snippet with M-/ then the snippet name is replaced by the content.\nExample: Using tab stops\nLets look at an existing snippet called form in the html-mode.  This expands into a html form, but also helps you jump from method, id, action and content.\n#contributor : Jimmy Wu &lt;frozenthrone88@gmail.com&gt;\n#name :&lt;form method=&quot;...&quot; id=&quot;...&quot; action=&quot;...&quot;&gt;&lt;/form&gt;\n# --\n&lt;form method=&quot;$1&quot; id=&quot;$2&quot; action=&quot;$3&quot;&gt;\n  $0\n&lt;/form&gt;\nThis snippet is the same as the simpler example, except we have added tab stops using the $ sign and a number.  When you expand this snippet, the snippet name is replaced by the content as usual but the cursor is placed at the first tab stop $1.  Each time you press TAB you move to the next tab stop.\n$0 is our exit point from the snippet, so pressing TAB reverts to the usual behaviour outside of YASnippet.\nFor more examples talk a look at the Emacs YASnippet video tutorial or the blogs: Adding YASnippets snippets &amp; Snippet expansion with YASnippet\nTesting your snippets\nOnce you have written your snippet, you can quickly test it using M-x yas-tryout-snippet.  This opens a new empty buffer in the appropriate major mode and inserts the snippet so you can then test it with M-/.\nIf you just want to try the snippet in an existing buffer, then use M-x yas-load-snippet-buffer to load this new snippet into the correct mode.

Also, as described above before, CIDER is smart\nenough to figure out the namespace containing the tests.\nUsing cider-test with alternative test libraries\nThe clojure.test machinery is designed to be pluggable. Any test library\ncan implement it if so desired, and therefore leverage cider-test. For\ninstance, test.check does this, and\ncider-test handles defspec just like deftest.\nAs a test framework author, supporting the built-in clojure.test machinery\n(and hence cider-test) is pretty straightforward:\n\nAssoc each test fn as :test metadata on some var.

Its goal is to provide a nice set of features operating on a project level without introducing external dependencies (when feasible). For instance - finding project files has a portable implementation written in pure Emacs Lisp without the use of GNU find (but for performance sake an indexing mechanism backed by external commands exists as well).\nProjectile tries to be practical - portability is great, but if some external tools could speed up some task substantially and the tools are available, Projectile will leverage them.\nThis library provides easy project management and navigation. The concept of a project is pretty basic - just a folder containing special file. Currently git, mercurial, darcs and bazaar repos are considered projects by default. So are lein, maven, sbt, scons, rebar and bundler projects. If you want to mark a folder manually as a project just create an empty .projectile file in it.

How to jump to a line number or jump the cursor a number of lines\nManipulating case of text\nCase Conversion Commands\nEmacs has commands for converting either a single word or any arbitrary range of text to upper case or to lower case.\nM-l\nConvert following word to lower case (downcase-word).\nM-u\nConvert following word to upper case (upcase-word).\nM-c\nCapitalize the following word (capitalize-word).\nC-x C-l\nConvert region to lower case (downcase-region).\nC-x C-u\nConvert region to upper case (upcase-region).\nM-l (downcase-word) converts the word after point to lower case, moving past it. Thus, repeating M-l converts successive words. M-u (upcase-word) converts to all capitals instead, while M-c (capitalize-word) puts the first letter of the word into upper case and the rest into lower case. All these commands convert several words at once if given an argument. They are especially convenient for converting a large amount of text from all upper case to mixed case, because you can move through the text using M-l, M-u or M-c on each word as appropriate, occasionally using M-f instead to skip a word.\nWhen given a negative argument, the word case conversion commands apply to the appropriate number of words before point, but do not move point. This is convenient when you have just typed a word in the wrong case: you can give the case conversion command and continue typing.\nIf a word case conversion command is given in the middle of a word, it applies only to the part of the word which follows point. (This is comparable to what M-d (kill-word) does.) With a negative argument, case conversion applies only to the part of the word before point.\nThe other case conversion commands are C-x C-u (upcase-region) and C-x C-l (downcase-region), which convert everything between point and mark to the specified case. Point and mark do not move.\nThe region case conversion commands upcase-region and downcase-region are normally disabled. This means that they ask for confirmation if you try to use them. When you confirm, you may enable the command, which means it will not ask for confirmation again. See Disabling.\nc\nTerminology\nFunctions\nFunction refers to the thing that you are calling when you hit a key or series of keys. For example j in normal modeis mapped to the function evil-next-line. In elisp these usually look like strings of hyphenated words. spc spc opens helm M-x and lets you search for functions by name and execute them. Note that functions may also be refered to as sexps (symbolic expressions).\nBuffers\nBuffers are like tabs in your browser. You open them from files on your computer instead of from the internet, and they stay open until you close them. Hit spc b b to see a searchable list of your open buffers, and recently opened buffers. spc b B opens a list of buffers organized by major mode. spc b d deletes the buffer you are currently in. As you can most the spc b commands are related to buffers. But buffers arent necessarily just files you open, they can also be generated by emacs (like the helm mini buffer (spc b b) you use to search buffers) to do useful things.\nThe Mode Line\nAt the bottom of the window, you will see the mode line. Its got some handy information in it. From left to right it shows you:\nYour window number. The color indicates what evil mode you are in (normal, insert, etc)\nA little * indicator if your file has been modified since it has been saved.\nBuffer size.\nBuffer name (same as file name if you have opened from file).\nMajor mode.\nMinor modes.\nOn the far right is info about where you are in a buffer. Move around whth hjkl and watch it if you dont get it at first.\nMajor Modes\nThis is how emacs organizes important sets of functionality. Each buffer will have one major mode at a time. It can customize anything about emacs so that it suits the buffer you are working with. There is a mode for editing C#, a mode for editing latex, a mode for viewing files (dired-mode), a mode for searching (helm-major-mode), a mode for emulating a terminal (term-mode). You can see what major mode you are in at the bottom of each buffer in your mode line. Usually this is automatically set depending on which buffer you are in. Major modes specific functions are on the , key (also spc m).\nMinor Modes\nMinor modes are smaller sets of custom behavior that can work together. A major mode will automatically set a bunch of relevant minor modes, but you can toggle them with spc t. For example spc t n toggles a minor mode for line numbers. You can hover over the symbols in the modeline with your mouse to see what minor mode each represents. spc h d m (help describe mode) opens a comprehensive list of your active minor modes. Move your cursor to one and hit enter to get more information.\nSide Note: The information opens in a split buffer titled help. Many of these buffers that are meant to be temporary can be closed quickly with q.\nLayers\nEverything so far (except specific key bindings) applies to emacs in general. Layers, however, are a spacemacs specific term. Layers are meant to be a simple way for you to customize your configuration by adding only one line to your .spacemacs file. See the list to see what are available. Check out the latex layer for example.\nThe .spacemacs file\nHit spc f e d (file emacs dotfile) to open this file. This is where you can customize everything. Find the dotspacemacs-configuration-layers line. You can use / in normal mode to start searching for it and enter when you have it. Add latex in that list. It should look like this:\ndotspacemacs-configuration-layers &#39;(\n  latex\n  other-layer\n  other-layer)\nNow spacemacs will load that layer on startup for you, which includes a major mode for editing latex and a bunch of commands. You can now either restart emacs, or hit spc f e R(file emacs reload) to reload your config. Now if you hit spc f f (file find) and open a latex file you should have some syntax highlighting and latex specific commands on your , key.\nWhy Vim ?\nPositives\n\nCut the Mouse - One of the main wins for Vim has always been that it is an editor that lets you keep your hands on the keyboard. Reaching for the mouse slows you down, and while I never really had a problem with that in the past (I spend more time thinking and reading than I do writing code), now that I’ve experienced 2 months with my hands on the keyboard I do find myself noticing (annoyingly) when I am forced to reach for the mouse.\n\nFast Navigation - Moving around inside files in most windows editors involves a lot of home/end/up/down arrow key. Having search and tag based navigation makes getting around within a file much faster. Finding the right file is also easier with the commandt plugin, influenced by Textmate on the Mac, this fuzzy file finder is not typically available in traditional windows editors (last time I looked)\n\nSplit Windows - Splitting windows into panes and navigating around them is a killer feature that I use all the time to see multiple files at once, or multiple areas of the same file at once. In the past I used tabs heavily, but I now prefer split panes that I can manage without reaching for the mouse.\n\n\nNegatives\nHJKL - Sorry, call me a heretic but I just cannot get used to using these keys for up/down/left/right. 20+ years of using the arrow keys is completely and utterly embedded in my brain. Besides, I’m pretty sure J (down) and K (up) are bass-ackwards. Western languages, and presumably most programming languages, read from TOP LEFT to BOTTOM RIGHT so shouldn’t UP be next to LEFT and DOWN be next to RIGHT ??? I know I could remap the keys, but plugins that follow similar patterns would also have to be remapped and I just could not get used to it.\n\nMode Struggles - The modal nature of Vim is both a blessing and a curse. Its the feature that allows us to keep our hands on the keyboards without the wrist breaking key combo’s of Emacs but its also far too easy to forget which mode you are in and start typing code only to discover you just executed 5 random commands. The people who recommend you ESC constantly back into command mode are absolutely correct. You have to shift your thinking into being primarily command based with short sharp bursts of INSERT.\n\nBreaking Windows - One of the side effects of the modal nature of vim is that it trains you to constantly hit ESCAPE to go back to command mode…. but when you do this in more traditional windows apps its quite possible you will end up dismissing a dialog while you are in the middle of typing! How frustrating! I hit this mostly when using Tortoise SVN for my code commits.\n\nDisappointing Plugins - Whilst some plugins are awesome, some are surprisingly disappointing. While I was really looking forward to them, the following plugins just didn’t get as much use as I expected session (doesn’t work well with NERDTree or quickfix window), taglist (doesn’t work well with dynamic languages - at the moment I use primarily Ruby and Javascript), Conque Shell - (nice idea, but doesn’t feel natural, just easier to use :shell or have another terminal open)\nEffort vs Reward\nOk. So I have a theory…\nVim proponents will tell you that the effort you spend learning vim will pay dividends in the long run once you know how to use it properly. After 60 days I can say that I agree with that opinion.\nHowever, if I spent this much effort learning any editor I think it would pay dividends in the long run. The difference is that Vim forces you to go through this pain, whilst other editors work ‘out the box’ and so most programmers are not inclined to learn the power of those editors.\nFor example, I think UltraEdit, TextMate, even Visual Studio are pretty good editors, but since they all pretty much just work out of the box, its easy to ignore their advanced features and not spend the time customizing and configuring them.\nI wonder if I spent 60 days really learning UltraEdit if I couldn’t get the same positives I described here ? Hmmm, a future article maybe?\nConclusion\nI’m still using Vim after 60 days, and I plan to continue using it for the foreseeable future as long as I can keep taking a little time here and there to dig deeper, customize a bit more, learn how to overcome the negatives and build upon the positives.\nVim seems to be so powerful that I could be learning it forever. Here’s a list of some of the things I want to spend time on in the future.\nMovement - I need to learn more code related movement commands like % match\nSessions - Both sessions.vim and sessionman.vim seem to struggle with NERDTree and the quickfix window\nCut &amp; Paste - I need to learn more about vim registers so I can manage my cut &amp; paste better, errr, sorry, I mean yank &amp; put\nUndo &amp; Redo - I think I spend too much time in insert mode so when I undo it tends to be more than I’d like\nHJKL - Maybe I should remap to swap the J and K keys and try again!\nMore Plugins - There are many more plugins I would like to take the time to check out, and perhaps build some of my own.\nprojectile\nSPC p p - switch to another project that spacemacs knows about\nranger\nA fast way to browse files and directories\nuse vim keybindings to navigate\nj / k -- up / down current directory\nl -- into the currently selected directory\nh -- up to parent directory\nq -- quit\nsome configuration to consider\n (ranger :variables\n         ranger-ignored-extensions &#39;(\n                                     &quot;mkv&quot; &quot;iso&quot; &quot;mp4&quot; &quot;avi&quot; &quot;mp4&quot; &quot;mkv&quot;\n                                     &quot;zip&quot; &quot;rar&quot; &quot;exe&quot; &quot;ps&quot; &quot;webm&quot; &quot;png&quot;\n                                     &quot;jpg&quot; &quot;jpeg&quot; &quot;tif&quot; &quot;tiff&quot; &quot;ics&quot; &quot;dmg&quot;\n                                     &quot;swf&quot; &quot;gz&quot; &quot;m4a&quot;)\n         ranger-max-preview-size 4  ;; Megabyte\n         ranger-cleanup-eagerly t\n         )\niedit-mode\nSPC s e\n\nBlog: http://nexusstar.name/hackpads/spacemacs-iedit-mode-cheat-sheat/\n\niedit-mode (aka interactive-edit-mode) gives you the power to edit instances of the same text string in a buffer. It’s quite similar to multiple cursors, although if you’re used to working with multiple cursors, it’s likely you’ll prefer that.\nIEdit defaults to selecting all matches, and then allows you to reduce and expand the matches in various ways, so the workflow is in the opposite direction.\nI use iedit often as a quick interactive replace all, and multiple cursors for anything in between that and more complicated regexp search replace.\nIn conjunction with wgrep-mode (that is a writeable grep mode, which works with most grep alternative tools as well) iedit-mode can become a poweful way to edit a string across many files and review the changes before you save them.\nTo install it use M-x package-install iedit\nOnce installed you can start it with C-; (M-x iedit-mode)\nNote, this doesn’t work in a terminal so in that case I’d bind it to C-c ;\nSpacemacs has a binding for IEdit mode on it’s SPACE leader (SPC s e)\nMultiple cursor options in spacemacs\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/spacemacs/comments/4641zt/how_the_heck_do_i_use_multicursor_support/\ngeneral stuff\nFrom: http://blog.christopher-atkins.com/more-spacemacs\nInter-file Navigation SPC b b open Helm mini-buffer SPC f f Helm find files, is less useful than SPC p f Projectile find files SPC p p Projectile find project\nUsing the Ranger layer (file manager) invoked using SPC a r (applications ranger) Consier using Unimpaired layer (tpope quick cycling) Consider using Fasd layer to complement Fasd\nIntra-file Navigation SPC s s SWOOP! opens a copy of the buffer then elides lines that don’t match the search you type, allowing you to navigate the top buffer by selecting lines in the swoop buffer\nWindow navigation SPC  navigate numbered windows Eyebrowse layer allows SPC W then a number to create/navigate to a new workspace with Eybrwose working you can using Vim’s gt and gT to\nEditing Select some text, then s  will surround with  iedit, get a selection (the whole current symbol by default) then SPC s e to enter iedit mode, allowing you to edit all the matched things at once SPC ; ; toggle line comment Diacritics in Emacs C-x 8 &#39; e to creates é\nHelp SPC h d invokes “help describe”, providing access to multipe ways of find help SPC f e h is canonical spacemacs help\nChecking SPC t s turns on syntax checking\nFuture layers to explore OrgMode + Capture mode Abbrev mode\nEditorconfig layer to manage things like indent and such\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "}}}
